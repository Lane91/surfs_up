# surfs_up

## Overview:
The purpose of this challenge is to show W. Avy temperture data for the months of June and December in Oahu, so he can determine if the surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year-round and worth his investment.

## Results:

- June's mean temperature is approximately 3.9 degrees higher then Decemberâ€™s
- December's min temperature is 8 degrees lower then June's
- December's overall rain fall is higher than the month of June

## Summary:
Even with the two months having some differences in weather pattern, if we look at the average temperature and rain fall for both months, we can determine that the viability of the surf and ice cream shop year around is good. When it comes to weather there are many variables and two that should be looked at for location purposes would be flood rates and hurricane patterns, knowing more information like this will help decide the best location for the shop and how best to protect it from mother nature.
